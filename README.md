# Time_series_Store_sales

Time series data analysis is a way of studying how a sequence of data points changes over time. It can help us understand the patterns, trends, and seasonality of the data, as well as forecast future values based on historical data. In this article, we will explore how to perform time series data analysis on a Kaggle competition dataset: Store Sales Time Series Forecasting.

The dataset contains the daily sales data for 10 different stores and 50 different items from January 1, 2013 to December 31, 2017. The goal of the competition is to predict the sales for each store and item for the next 90 days. To do this, we will use various methods and techniques of time series analysis, such as:

- Exploratory data analysis: To visualize and summarize the characteristics of the data, such as stationarity, autocorrelation, and seasonality.
- Feature engineering: To create new variables that can capture useful information from the data, such as lagged values, moving averages, and date components.
- Model selection and evaluation: To choose and compare different models that can fit the data and make accurate predictions, such as ARIMA, exponential smoothing, and neural networks.

We will use Python and various libraries, such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, statsmodels, and sklearn to perform the analysis. We will also use Kaggle's notebook environment to run the code and submit the predictions. Let's get started!
